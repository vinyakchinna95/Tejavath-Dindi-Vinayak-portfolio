          <p>
            As a dedicated software engineer, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of
            artificial intelligence and web development. My approach to learning is fundamentally
            different â€” I believe in <span className="highlight">learning by constructing</span>
            rather than just following textbooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            This philosophy has led me to build numerous projects that not only showcase my technical
            skills but also demonstrate my ability to solve real-world problems. From stock market
            prediction systems to full-stack web applications, each project has been a stepping stone
            in my continuous learning journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm particularly drawn to AI tools and machine learning because they represent the future
            of technology. Combined with my web development skills, I strive to create intelligent,
            user-friendly applications that make a meaningful impact.
